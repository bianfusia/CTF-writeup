## Kali 2020 as root

If you would like to use root instead of the none superuser account kali, here are the instructions to do so:

```
Issue command “sudo su”

password: kali
```

Issue command 
```passwd root```

<Enter new password and retype that password>

At this point you can log-off and re log-in or you can just switch the user and log in as root.
